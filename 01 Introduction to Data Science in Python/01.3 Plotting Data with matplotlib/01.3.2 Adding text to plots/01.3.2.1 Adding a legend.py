Adding a legend
Officers Deshaun, Mengfei, and Aditya have all been working with you to solve the kidnapping of Bayes. Their supervisor wants to know how much time each officer has spent working on the case.

Deshaun created a plot of data from the DataFrames deshaun, mengfei, and aditya in the previous exercise. Now he wants to add a legend to distinguish the three lines.

# Officer Deshaun
plt.plot(deshaun.day_of_week, deshaun.hours_worked, label='Deshaun')

# Add a label to Aditya's plot
plt.plot(aditya.day_of_week, aditya.hours_worked, label='Aditya')

# Add a label to Mengfei's plot
plt.plot(mengfei.day_of_week, mengfei.hours_worked, label='Mengfei')

# Add a command to make the legend display
